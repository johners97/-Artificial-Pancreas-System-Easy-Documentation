`'Slow and Steady Wins the Race'` - Angela Merkel 

This is an easy to follow instruction manual to produce an Artificial Pancreas System. This is not for personal use, obviously; just for producing a system for research purposes. I do not personally recommend that you use the system you produce, that's up to you. It doesn't go without saying this is aimed at Type 1 Diabetics ready to think out of the box and contribute to innovation for themselves and step outside their comfort zone.

Do not proceed with this unless you are experienced enough to understand the intricacies of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. For instance, understand what Insulin Sensitivity is, blood glucose ranges, how your blood glucose changes with respect to innumerable factors (based on your lifestyle you should know what they are), how to operate an insulin pump, understand what Insulin on Board is. 

Meter Blood Glucose: mmol/L does not equate to Plasma Blood Glucose: mmol/L and it shouldn't. The quantity of glucose present in your blood is not equally distributed. Blood moves around your body so, in a sense, it's mixing around the glucose so it should reach equilibrium more quickly but since there are constant inputs and outputs; for instance, renal extretion of glucose, glucose being oxidised by enzymes in cells for energy, glucose production from enzymatic processes in the liver and of course, glucose absorption through the GI tract into the blood circulation. Therefore, as long as inputs `(mmol/L/hour) = outputs (mmol/L/hour)` for a prolonged period of time until blood glucose equally distributes for any set period of time.
