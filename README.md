`'Slow and Steady Wins the Race'` - Angela Merkel 

This is an easy to follow instruction manual to produce an Artificial Pancreas System. This is not for personal use, obviously; just for producing a system for research purposes. I do not personally recommend that you use the system you produce, that's up to you. It doesn't go without saying this is aimed at Type 1 Diabetics ready to think out of the box and contribute to innovation for themselves and step outside their comfort zone.

Do not proceed with this unless you are experienced enough to understand the intricacies of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. For instance, understand what Insulin Sensitivity is, blood glucose ranges, how your blood glucose changes with respect to innumerable factors (based on your lifestyle you should know what they are), how to operate an insulin pump, understand what Insulin on Board is.
